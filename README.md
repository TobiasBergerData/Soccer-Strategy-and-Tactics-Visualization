# Soccer-Strategy-and-Tactics-Visualization

In this little project, I was messing around with StatsBomb soccer data. I imagined myself being part of the German Women's national team staff, analyzing the English team right before their finals game in the European Championship 2022.

After finishing my PhD analyzing the NBA, I wanted to look at the sport I played as a teenager again to see what the data and analytics landscape looks like. So keep this in mind, when reading my thoughts and checking my plots here. Basketball-mind switching sports just for fun to check out the incredibly interesting StatsBomb database, hoping to learn something from interdisciplinary application of methods.


**Intro thoughts on how to evaluate past performance of England (please keep in mind):**

- Coming from basketball analyzing an international soccer tournament, the caveat of sample size cannot be highlighted enough. But of course we can only use the 5 games played before since we want to this particular squad in this particular environment.
- With this particular English team and their path to the final there is even more to take into account. The team swiftly danced through their group games, possibly inflating their stats beating up on weaker opponnents with scoring an unusual amount of goals. 
- While this is a quality not every strong team possesses, tending to coast a little bit an leaving flipping on the switch for the games that really matter (like the Shaq/Kobe Lakers did quite a few times in the beginning of the 2000s), we should value the games after the group stage a little more. There the English team was pushed much more, playing much stronger teams. 
- How they handled this situation should resemble their possible approach to the final much more than their lower pressure, rather easy games from early in the tournament.
- While data is important and can tell us valuable stories, I would also treat the findings with some caution. Only data-points aren't enough. This report would give some advice, but ideally would be confirmed with video scouting as well. I can only show general trends here. However, these analayses might give us interesting, novel starting points for breaking down film.
